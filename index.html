          <h2>Timeline of Prof. Zewail's life journey</h2>
          <dl>
            <dt>1946</dt>
            <dd>Born on February 26, 1946 in Damanhūr, Egypt.</dd>

            <dt>1967</dt>
            <dd>
              Graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Science, with the highest
              honors – “Distinction with First Class Honor” – with above 90% in
              all areas of chemistry.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              Appointed to a University position as a demonstrator (“Moeid”), to
              carry on research toward a Masters and then a Ph.D. degree, and to
              teach undergraduates at the University of Alexandria.
            </dd>

            <dt>1969</dt>
            <dd>
              Aquired his Masters of Science (M.S.) degree from Alexandria
              University, working mainly on spectral changes of various
              molecules in different solvents.
            </dd>

            <dt>1974</dt>
            <dd>
              Zewail attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a
              doctorate (Ph.D.)
            </dd>
            <dd>
              Zewail began his postdoctoral work in the College of Chemistry,
              University of California at Berkeley, in the group of Charles B.
              Harris. This was a significant turning point in his career, for it
              was while working with Harris that the importance of the concept
              of coherence occurred to him.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              He and Harris published several papers on coherence in
              electronically excited dimers.
            </dd>

            <dt>1976</dt>
            <dd>Accepting Caltech offer of Assistant Professorship.</dd>

            <dd>Won the King Faisal International Prize from Saudi Arabia.</dd>
            <dd>
              In March, he met Dema, his wife. They met in March, got engaged in
              July and married in September, all of the same year, 1989.

            <dt>1990</dt>
            <dd>
              Selected as the school’s first Linus Pauling Professor of Chemical
              Physics.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              Zewail also served as a visiting professor at a number of
              institutions, including Texas A&M University, the University of
              Iowa, and American University at Cairo.
            </dd>

            <dt>1999</dt>
            <dd>
              Won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1999 for developing a rapid
              laser technique that enabled scientists to study the action of
              atoms during chemical reactions.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              Because chemical reactions last only 10 to 100 femtoseconds
              (fs)—one femtosecond is 0.000000000000001 second, or 10
              <sup>-15</sup>, this breakthrough created a new field of physical
              chemistry known as femtochemistry.
            </dd>
            <dd>
              Zewail was the first Egyptian and the first Arab to win a Nobel
              Prize in a science category.
            </dd>
